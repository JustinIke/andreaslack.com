![Andrea Slack](/assets/images/about-image.jpg)

​Born and raised in Japan to Canadian parents and now living in Calgary, Canada, Andrea’s life was enriched as a third culture kid. The Japan Sea was her back yard, so to speak, and to this day Andrea has a deep attachment to the ocean which has influenced her art today. Now living close to the Rockies, nature inspires her as she paints landscapes, florals, seascapes and wildlife.

Always exploring,  mixed media using collage and gold leaf are finding new ways of expression in her paintings.  Andrea also teaches painting classes,  sharing her passion of the arts with others.
Andrea’s work has been well received across Western and Eastern Canada, as well as the United States. Currently her work is showing at The Painted Moose Artist Collective in Bragg Creek where she also gives instruction in art.
