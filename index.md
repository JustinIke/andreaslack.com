![Come Walk With Me](/assets/images/paintings/wildlife/casper.jpg)

Do you have a deep love of nature as I do? Walk with me on the trails I frequent which are the main inspiration for my paintings. The trails take me around Calgary and beyond to the mountains and occasionally to the sea. As you walk along I hope that you will catch the deep sense of serenity and rejuvenation found in my art and make a connection that resonates within you.
